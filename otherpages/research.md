## Case Studies

A case study is an in depth study of a particular situation. It is a method used to narrow down a very broad field of research into one easily researchable topic. A case study encompasses a problem contextualized around the application of in-depth analysis, interpretation, and discussion, often resulting in specific recommendations for action or for improving existing conditions.

This type of research study will not typically answer a question completely, but it will give strong indications about future directions for your work.

Spend some time clarifying your **purpose** for your Capstone project. Let the case studies you choose be informed by your purpose statement.

**You must conduct 4 individual case studies and pdf summary for each.**
