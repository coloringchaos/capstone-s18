## Make it Real

The final half of the Capstone 1 semester is dedicated to prototyping. During this phase you will take the ideas from your research and begin to implement the concepts through prototypes. The purpose of a prototype is to test or explore one aspect or feature of a project (it is NOT a rough version of the *whole* project), and each prototype should have a clearly identified intention.

Prototypes can take many forms including Role, Look and Feel, and Implementation prototypes. Refer to [*What do Prototypes Prototype*](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/30bc/6125fab9d9b2d5854223aeea7900a218f149.pdf) for additional clarification on this.

## Blog Responses

Each week you are required to write a blog post about your prototyping progress. Include pictures, code snippets, tutorial links, videos, interaction drawings, schematics, etc. During this phase you will be getting your hands dirty, engaging in a process of active making, and beginning to turn your idea into reality. You should engage in a different prototype each week (or different aspect of your project), so that this process allows you to answer a lot of questions about the *how* of your project. Your blog post should start by clearly explaining the purpose of your weekly prototype, then outline what you actually did by ***showing*** what you created.

You will have three blog posts due during this phase, submit your post before class on the following dates:

Monday, April 9th<br>
Monday, April 16th<br>
Monday, April 23rd

<!-- ## Materials

Because there are no textbook fees for this course, the cost of supplies is largely the student's responsibility.

ATLAS can cover a small cost per student for materials if the request is approved. If you would like to take advantage of this, please [submit a proposal for funds](). If approved, your instructor will coordinate the order of these supplies. CU works with preferred vendors (which means some places are easier to order from than others), please discuss these options prior to submitting a request.

## Presentation

Your instructor will review your progress via the blog each week and will be available for project development discussion.

You will present a summary of your prototyping progress in class on April 23rd. Be prepared to share your work and discuss what you learned.
