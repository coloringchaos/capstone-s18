Prepare an 8-10 minute presentation that explains what you learned in your case studies and the direction that you intend to pursue for the future.

### Presentation Structure

Spend the first half or more of your presentation sharing <span class="underlined">**what you researched**</span> in your case studies. I recommend just one slide for each case study that includes a full-width image or graphics and very minimal text. Your slides should provide supplemental visual information for your audience and use text only for titles and labels and to emphasize an important point.

Spend the last part of your presentation explaining <span class="underlined">**what you plan to do next**</span>. The next phase of this project is beginning to test out your concept and create a series of prototypes. Include at least 2 or 3 ideas of something you want to build to explore the next level of your project. Think of these as little studies, that will help you understand how to make your project a reality. These slides should include sketches, diagrams, or anything that visually explains this next step.

Somewhere in your presentation you should concisely say <span class="underlined">**what your project is**</span> (at this point) in a way that communicates the purpose of the work. This might come at the very beginning of your presentation, or it might come at the end of your case studies.

### Presentation Suggestions

Your slides should be thoughtfully designed, do not rely on a pre-baked slideshow template to make it look visually nice. Design your own slides, and lean heavily on media to explain your content. I suggest starting with a blank template, white or black, and picking one or two fonts to use throughout your slides. Then rely on high quality media (images, graphics, sketches..) to visually communicate your ideas.

Tell your presentation as a story and connect to your audience. Utilize presenter notes. And practice!!!
