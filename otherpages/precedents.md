## Domains, Precedents & Questions

Whether you have a Capstone project in mind or not, spend some time brainstorming your potential project interests.

I like to start this process using sticky notes or by creating a mind-map, since it allows me to rearrange and search for connections between things. I also like ranking things. Focus on brainstorming freely with a totally open mind (linear lists are boring..). This exercise is like a brain dump - get *any* idea you might have related to Capstone out of your head and onto paper! Then, you will organize your ideas into the following categories.

+ **Domains and Methods**– the field or discipline, the form of procedure, the technology or tools<br>
+ **Precedents** – references, example projects, practitioners, companies<br>
+ **Questions** – “how could I…?”, “what if…?”, etc..

Really spend some time with this. Be thoughtful and focus on clarifying the kind of work that is most meaningful to you, where it will exist, and why! I expect that your domain and precedent categories are extensive (15+?), you may have fewer questions (3-6ish?).

## Goals & Motivations

Take some time over the next week to clarify what success will mean to you in the context of this project /
course / experience. Make two lists of your goals and objectives for Capstone - one focusing on the
internal experience, one on the tangible project or product. You do not need to post this to your blog,
you are welcome to just turn it in to me personally.
+ In the context of your Capstone project and experience in this course, what will success ***feel*** like?
(internal / emotional / personal)
+ What will your success look like ***externally***? (external / tangible)

Write a paragraph for each category, or a list of bulleted sentences.
