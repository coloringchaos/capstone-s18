You are expected to keep an online journal of your progress throughout this class. Ongoing documentation of your research, your design and production process, testing, and methodology is a major part of your final project and functions in lieu of a lengthly paper.

Your instructor will read this journal to see how you are progressing, so you should update your journal regularly over the course of the semester. Post a summary of your week’s progress on your blog regularly as the semester progresses.

## Expectations

Capstone is an opportunity to create a long-term project that is meaningful to you in some way. As such, a significant aspect of the learning experience lies in the <span class="underlined">***process***</span> - in your successes, failures, experiments and meanderings. Your online journal is a place to record this experience, as well as track your progress in the course. Your final evaluation will largely be based on this journal documentation.


<span class="underlined">**Your online journal is not a portfolio!**</span> You may have a personal portfolio already (if not, you should be thinking seriously about creating one!), or you may build a website to feature your particular Capstone project...this is NOT the same thing as your online journal. The journal should contain your notes, ideas, references, and so on. <span class="underlined">***Focus on the process.***</span>


If you use your online journal for other classes or content (which I highly encourage), <span class="underlined">***you must have a dedicated category for Capstone.***</span>

## Cite your sources

Make sure to reference the sources where you get ideas, inspirations, how-to's, code, circuits, etc... <span class="underlined">***When you base your work on someone else’s, cite the original author and link to their work, just as you would when quoting another author in a paper.***</span> If you only changed one part of an existing program, post only the part you changed, and link to the original. Copying code or techniques without attribution is plagiarism.  Few ideas come out of the blue, and your readers can learn a lot from the sources from which you learned and by which you were were inspired. So be generous in sharing your sources.

Remember, your journal lives on the internet, so use **hyperlinks** generously throughout your posts!!

## Resources / Suggestions

+ I highly recommend using [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) for your online journal - it is free and offers the cleanest layouts of any free blogging platform. It is also platform that you can continue to build on in the future (like, when you become internet famous!)
+ Use [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) to embedding videos in your posts.
+ [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) is an ideal way to share code on your blog.
+ Photos and videos should be taken in landscape orientation.
